# Books App

Book App is a mobile application built with Flutter that allows users to browse and search for books. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing a personal book library, tracking which books have been read, and discovering new reading material.

## Features
 - Displays a list of books as cards, each containing the book cover, title, author, published year, and a book status button indicating whether the book has been read or not.
 - Allows users to toggle the status of a book between "Read" and "Unread" with a single tap
 - Users can search for books by title

## Data Source
The app fetches book information from the <a href='https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs' >Open Library API </a>. It retrieves book covers using the cover ID provided in the API response.
